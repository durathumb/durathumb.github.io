DuraThumb was conceptualized by Stella Wang, a certified hand therapist, out of the desire to stabilize the natural hypermobility of her own thumb while doing joint mobilizations. She could not find a commercial splint that was sturdy, well-fitted, and not bulky. The first prototype was made with low-temperature thermoplastic, which failed to stand up to any abuse. With the help of some engineering friends, the first 3D-printed prototype was created. The success led to more rapid prototyping. More than 20 designs were created before DuraThumb 

Custom fitting is currently only available in the Bay area, we hope to develop methods to remotely capture the measurements to expand the service.
