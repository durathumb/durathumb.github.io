title: What is DuraThumb?
---

DuraThumb is a custom 3D-printed thumb stabilization splint. It supports your thumb in gripping and pinching tasks without compromising the functional mobility of the hand.

The thumb is the most dynamic and functional part of the hand. The thumb comprises of three joints: the interphalangeal (IP) joint, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, and the  carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. Each one is stacked on top of the other like building blocks of a tower. Injury to any one of them will lead to increased stress of the other joints. When pinching or gripping, DuraThumb functions like an exoskeleton by maintaining the alignment of the thumb metacarpal and stabilizing the MCP joint. Since each model is created parametrically using measurements of your thumb, we can guarantee a perfect fit.
