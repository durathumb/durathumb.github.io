title: What is DuraThumb? 
---

DuraThumb is a custom 3D-printed thumb stabilization splint. It supports your thumb in gripping and pinching tasks without compromising the functional mobility of the hand.

The thumb is the most dynamic and functional part of the hand. The thumb comprises of three joints: the interphalangeal (IP) joint, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, and the  carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. Each one is stacked on top of the other like building blocks of a tower. Injury to any one of them will lead to increased stress of the other joints. When pinching or gripping, DuraThumb functions like an exoskeleton by maintaining the alignment of the thumb metacarpal and stabilizing the MCP joint. Since each model is created parametrically using measurements of your thumb, we can guarantee a perfect fit. 

# Who is DuraThumb for? 

Anyone who wants support for their thumb to prevent injury, relieve pain and fatigue:
- You work in a job that requires constant use of you thumb: ex. dentists/hygienist, massage therapist/physical therapist, surgeon, electronics technician. 
- You participate in sports that could injure your thumb either through impact or overuse: ex. baseball, hand cycling, skiing, volleyball
- Those that already has a thumb injury and needs support to allow the tissue to heal: ex. Skier’s thumb, early arthritis
- You have hypermobility or instability in your joints: ex. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, hypermobility syndrome


# What is 3D printing? 

3D-printing is a method of adding or solidifying material to create a three-dimensional object based on a computer model. After months of refinding the design, the result is a durable, personalized, and cost-effective splint.
